How to make corrections:
------------------------
1. Edit this googlespreadheet iGEM Database https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvRcIbigV-eYdGNHMmxGVy13UkhpUi1Vck9zMmZRSUE#gid=0
2. Submit an issue to inform me of the update: https://github.com/mgaldzic/igemsoft/issues


How it works:
-------------
Google spreadsheet iGEM Database for Exhibit contains the data and is automatically loaded by exhibit

.html eg "index.html" is the template page

Exhibit 3.0 runs the JavaScript to display the page
see Exhibit 3.0 for generic docs: http://www.simile-widgets.org/exhibit3/

How to update
------------

1. Copy iGEM Database (public allowed to edit) into iGEM Database for Exhibit (public view)
